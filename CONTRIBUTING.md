# Contributor Guide

Thank you for your interest in improving this project.
This project is open-source under the [MIT license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

- [Source Code]
- [Issue Tracker]
- [Code of Conduct]

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/aidee-health/embody-file/issues

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.11+ and the following tools:

- [UV] - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- [tox] - Standardized testing in Python

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ make install
```

This will set up your environment using UV and install pre-commit hooks.

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ uv run python
$ uv run embody-file
```

[tox]: https://tox.wiki/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite using the Makefile:

```console
$ make test
```

For more complex testing across multiple Python versions, use tox:

```console
$ tox
```

List the available tox environments:

```console
$ tox --listenvs
```

You can also run a specific tox environment:

```console
$ tox -e py312
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The test suite must pass without errors and warnings across all supported Python versions.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains high code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can use:

```console
$ make check
```

Pre-commit hooks are installed automatically when you run `make install`, ensuring code quality checks run before each commit.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## Code Quality Standards

When contributing code, please follow these standards:

### Pandas Operations
- **Avoid inplace operations**: Use `df = df.operation()` instead of `df.operation(inplace=True)`
- **Create copies when modifying DataFrames**: Use `df.copy()` when you need to modify a DataFrame without affecting the original

### Exception Handling
- **Use specific exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `IOError`, `ValueError`) instead of broad `except Exception`
- **Provide context**: Include helpful error messages that explain what went wrong

### Code Organization
- **Use common utilities**: When modifying exporters, use shared utilities from `src/embodyfile/exporters/common.py` for:
  - Directory creation (`ensure_directory`)
  - Device info export (`export_device_info_to_dataframe`)
  - Schema filtering (`should_skip_schema`)
  - Timestamp handling (`prepare_timestamp_column`)
  - HDF metadata storage (`store_hdf_frequency_metadata`)
- **Follow DRY principle**: Don't duplicate code that already exists in common utilities

### Performance
- **Batch operations**: When writing to HDF files, use a single store context for multiple writes
- **Chain operations**: Chain DataFrame operations where possible to minimize copies

### Logging

This library follows Python logging best practices:

- **Use module loggers**: Each module should have `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- **Never configure root logger**: The library uses its own logger hierarchy (`embodyfile.*`)
- **Performance guards for expensive operations**: Use `if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.LEVEL)` before expensive string formatting or calculations
- **Simple operations don't need guards**: Direct logging calls for simple strings are fine

Example:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Simple logging - no guard needed
logger.info("Processing started")

# Expensive operation - use guard
if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):
    logger.debug(f"Processed {len(data)} items: {expensive_format(data)}")
```

## Using the Makefile

This project includes a Makefile with convenient shortcuts for common development tasks:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make install` | Set up the development environment and install pre-commit hooks |
| `make check` | Run code quality checks (linting, formatting) |
| `make test` | Run the test suite with pytest |
| `make build` | Build the package (wheel and sdist) |
| `make clean-build` | Remove build artifacts |
| `make help` | Display all available commands |
